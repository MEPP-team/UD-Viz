# Documentation

This documentation is generated using [JSDOC](https://jsdoc.app/) and [Clean-Jsdoc-Theme](https://github.com/ankitskvmdam/clean-jsdoc-theme).

## Getting started

To **generate** the documentation :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VCityTeam/UD-Viz.git
cd UD-Viz
npm install
npm run back-end # This command serve local doc at http://localhost:8000/docs/html/
npm run docs # Generate doc
```

The produced documentation should be in the [docs/html](./html/) repository.

> The latest released version is hosted by _Github Pages_ here : https://vcityteam.github.io/UD-Viz/html/index.html

## Contribute

To document source code, refer to [JSDOC](https://jsdoc.app/) syntax. You can run `npm run dev-docs` command to regenerate documentation each time you change packages' sources.

To document everything else (diagrams, tutorials, etc...), simply add them to the [static](./static/) directory. See [jsdoc-tutorials](https://jsdoc.app/about-tutorials.html) for more information.
