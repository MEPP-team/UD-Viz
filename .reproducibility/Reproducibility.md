The following stale branches

* reproductibility/article-temporel-3DTiles
* reproductibility/article-temporel-3DTilesTemporal

that have been deleted for sake of simplicity, can still be
respectively retrieved through their associated tags with

* `git checkout -b reproductibility/article-temporel-3DTiles reproductibility/article-temporel-3DTiles-tag`
* `git checkout -b reproductibility/article-temporel-3DTilesTemporal reproductibility/article-temporel-3DTilesTemporal-tag`

Refer to [this StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1309934/5649243) for a description
